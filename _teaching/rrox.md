I am a [Fellow at Reproducible Research Oxford](https://ox.ukrn.org/people/#ConorKeogh). 
I teach computational techniques for research with a focus on medical applications.

Course content
------

I run workshops based on the [Software Carpentry curriculum](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons). 
These are aimed at participants with little to no experience with computational techniques, but who would like to improve their research practices.
I have a particular focus on training participants from a medical background in high-quality, reproducible research techniques.
I am a Software Carpentry instructor and all workshops qualify for accredication with The Carpentries.
