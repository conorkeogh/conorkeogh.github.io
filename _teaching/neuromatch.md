I was an instructor in computational neuroscience for the Neuromatch Academy three-week summer school in 2021.

Course content
------

The Neuromatch Academy course covers a range of material from introductory to advanced topics in computational neuroscience. It is organsed into modules on modelling methods, machine learning, dynamical systems and stochastic processes.

The summer school is run annually. All course material is [available online](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io).
