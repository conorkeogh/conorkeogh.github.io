I am a postdoctoral researcher in neural interfacing at the Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford. I work in a joint role as an Academic Clinical Fellow in neurosurgery at the John Radcliffe Hospital. My work focuses on the application of engineering techniques to the management of nervous system pathology.

I completed degrees in medicine and neural engineering in Trinity College Dublin, during which I focused primarily on neurostimulation techniques and on the development of statistical signal processing methods for neural signals, in addition to a period as a visiting student in ETH Zurich, where I worked on fabrication of novel electrode arrays using stretchable electronics for spinal cord injury repair.

I then worked in a joint academic-clinical post in Ireland, during which my research focused on developing methods for multi-material 3D printing with conductive materials in order to produce patient-specific electrode arrays for bioelectronic interfacing.

I completed a DPhil with the Oxford Neural Interfacing group, focusing on the use of computational modelling techniques to develop patient-specific targeted stimulation protocols using non-invasive electric fields. This work was supported by scholarships from the Clarendon Fund, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the National Institute for Health Research and Trinity College, Oxford.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher and Academic Clinical Fellow in neural interfacing technologies. My work in based on the development of techniques for targeted electrical neuromodulation in neurological disease with the aim of restoring function to the damaged nervous system and preventing predictable functional loss. 

I work closely with colleagues across a range of disciplines, including engineering, neurophysiology and neurosurgery. I am interested in the application of interdisciplinary approaches to improve techniques for functional restoration and in the translation of research insights into real impact through engagement with tech transfer.

I am available for tutorials for students at the University of Oxford. I teach a regular tutorial series on neurophysiology for medical students. I have previously taught neuroanatomy at undergraduate and postgraduate level and have developed and delivered a special study module on the basic science of neuromodulation. For postgraduate students, I teach workshops on computational skills for research and data analysis through Reproducible Research Oxford. For clinical trainees, I run a regular teaching and mentorship programme at the Department of Neurosurgery through our Junior Clinical Fellowship. Feel free to contact me for more details on any of these.
