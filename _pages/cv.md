Summary
======
**DPhil student, Oxford Neural Interfacing, University of Oxford**  
I am a clinical-academic trainee in neurosurgery, currently completing an EPSRC-funded DPhil on the application of engineering techniques to the management of nervous system pathology using neuromodulation at the University of Oxford, based at the John Radcliffe Hospital. 

My current work is based on detailed computational modelling of the anatomy and physiology of neural systems and their interaction with external electric fields with the aim of developing techniques for targeted electrical neuromodulation in neurological disease.
