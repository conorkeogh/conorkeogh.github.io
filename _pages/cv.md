Summary
======
**Postdoctoral Researcher and Academic Clinical Fellow, Oxford Neural Interfacing**  
I am a postdoctoral researcher in neural interfacing at the Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford. I work in a joint role as an Academic Clinical Fellow in neurosurgery at the John Radcliffe Hospital, having previously completed a DPhil on the application of engineering techniques to the management of nervous system pathology using neuromodulation.

My work is based on the development of techniques for targeted electrical neuromodulation in neurological diseases with the aim of restoring function to the damaged nervous system and preventing predictable functional loss. I work closely with colleagues across a range of disciplines, including engineering, neurophysiology and neurosurgery. I am interested in the application of interdisciplinary approaches to improve techniques for functional restoration and in the translation of research insights into real impact through engagement with tech transfer.

Interests
=====

My primary sport is rowing. During my undergraduate studies, I was a member of the Senior squad of the Dublin University Boat Club and part of the university's high performance athletics programme. I won a number of national and university championships and competed at a high level internationally, including as an invited crew at Henley Royal Regatta. I was admitted as a Life Member of the Lady Elizabeth Boat Club, the University's alumni club, based on my achievements. During my time at Oxford, I was a member of the Oxford University Boat Club. I won medals at a number of major events, including the London Metropolitan Regatta, and was the reserve cox for the 2021 Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race. Although I no longer compete, I continue to be involved in coaching and engage in recreational running and cycling.
